# Count letters

## Release / Update date

## Description
Write a function countLetters that **takes a string returns an object** where letters are keys and occurences of those letters are values.

Be sure to meet the following requirements from the tests:
    1) should work for all strings
    2) should still work if string has spaces
    3) should be case sensitive (e.g M & m should be counted seperately)
    4) should work for an empty string

Example:
```javascript
countLetters('hello')

// returns:
{
    'h': 1,
    'e': 1,
    'l': 2,
    'o': 1,
}
```
